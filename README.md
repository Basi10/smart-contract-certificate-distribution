# End-to-End Web3 dApps

## Introduction

Web3 technology is inherently about the user controlled internet. It is being achieved by a growing stack of decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, oracles, crypto wallets, storage networks, and more.

## Objective

This project tries to enable clients to be able to solve the challenges ensuring that certificates are available to all trainees in a secure way, and (if possible) that certificate holders can benefit from smart contract actions now and in the future. At present, certificates are distributed as simple PDF files, without the ability to verify their authenticity nor can trainer undertake smart actions with the trainees/their contracts.

## Usage

###

Both the front-end and the back-end have to be started.
